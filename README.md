#HTML5 Canvas Demo

http://chrislongo.net/html5/canvas/

This is a demo of an effect I've played with all the way back to
    the x86 assembler days.  I'm teaching myself HTML5 so this
    seemed like a good example to start with.  It's either a fire 
    or lava demo, depending on how you perceive it.

Funny that a demo that could barely
    run 30fps @ 320x200 back in the day still struggles at the
    same resolution considering all the indirection involved with 
    HTML5 and JavaScript. There's a lot of cheating going on to 
    hit 30fps including pixel doubling and interlacing the updates 
    to only draw half the pixels each frame.

I get around 30fps on a mid-2011 MacBook Air and about the same
    an older Mac Pro (desktop).  Using Chromium 19.  Safari 5 is 
    a few FPS slower. My iPad 1 gets less than 5fps :)
