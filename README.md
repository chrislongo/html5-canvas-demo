#HTML5 Canvas Demo

http://chrislongo.net/html5/canvas/

This is a demo of an effect I've played with all the way back to
the x86 assembler days.  I'm teaching myself HTML5 so this
seemed like a good example to start with.  It's either a fire 
or lava demo, depending on how you perceive it.

Funny that a demo that could barely
run @ 320x200 back in the day still struggles at the
same resolution considering all the indirection involved with 
HTML5 and JavaScript. There's a lot of cheating going on to 
hit ~30fps including pixel doubling.

I get around 25fps on a mid-2011 MacBook Air and about the same
an older Mac Pro (desktop).  Using Chromium 19.  Safari 5 is 
a few FPS slower. My iPad 1 gets less than 5fps :)
