#HTML5 Canvas Demo

http://chrislongo.net/html5/canvas/

This is a demo of an effect I've played with all the way back to
the x86 assembler days.  I'm teaching myself HTML5 so this
seemed like a good example to start with.  It's either a fire 
or lava demo, depending on how you perceive it.

I get around 60fps on a mid-2011 MacBook Air and about the same
an older Mac Pro (desktop).  Using Chromium 19.  Safari 5 is 
a few FPS slower. My iPad 1 gets less than 5fps :)
